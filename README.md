# Rock Paper Scissors: AI-Enhanced Versions for Python Learners

This project showcases multiple AI-enhanced versions of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, offering a valuable opportunity to explore different coding approaches and techniques.

## Project Overview

We started with the original Python code for Rock Paper Scissors from Microsoft Learn, then asked several AI language models to create their own improved versions. This repository contains the original code, AI-enhanced versions, and detailed explanations of the improvements made by each AI.

## AI Models Featured

- ChatGPT
- Gemini
- Llama3
- Mistral
- Perplexity

## Repository Contents

- `rock-paper-scissor-5.py`: The original code, slightly modified
- `rock-paper-scissor-5.md`: AI-generated description of the original code's behavior
- For each AI model:
  - `rock-paper-scissor-[AI_NAME].py`: The AI-improved Python code
  - `rock-paper-scissor-[AI_NAME].md`: Detailed explanation of improvements

## Learning Opportunities

As you explore each version, pay attention to:

1. Code structure and organization
2. Error handling and input validation
3. Game logic implementations
4. User interface enhancements
5. Performance optimizations
6. Use of different Python features and techniques

## Why This Matters for Python Learners

This project demonstrates that even for a simple game, there are multiple valid approaches. By studying these variations, you'll expand your Python knowledge and develop a more flexible approach to coding.

## Challenge Yourself

1. Run and compare each version
2. Identify your favorite elements from different implementations
3. Try to create your own improved version, combining ideas from various sources

## Which Version Do You Prefer?

After examining the different versions, consider which approach you find most effective or interesting. Do you prefer concise code or more detailed implementations? Is there a particular Python feature you're excited to use in your own projects?

## Contributing

Feel inspired? Fork this repository and create your own version of the game. We welcome pull requests with new AI-enhanced versions or further improvements to existing ones.
