**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to each class and method for better code readability and understanding.
* **Meaningful Names:** Renamed variables and methods to be more descriptive (e.g., `choose` to `choose_participant`, `toNumericalChoice` to `choice.index("rock")`).
* **Improved Input Handling:** Used `f-strings` for cleaner string formatting and simplified user input handling in `check_end_condition`.
* **Function Separation:** Separated winner determination logic into its own method `determine_winner` for better organization.
* **Main Guard:** Added an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure the game code only runs when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

These changes improve the code's readability, maintainability, and overall structure while preserving the core functionality of the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game.
