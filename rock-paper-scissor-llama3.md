Changes made:
1. **Consistent naming conventions**: I used consistent naming conventions throughout the code, following PEP 8 style guide.
2. **Type hints**: I added type hints for function parameters and return types to improve code readability and facilitate static type checking.
3. **F-strings**: I replaced string formatting with f-strings, which are more readable and efficient.
4. **Improved comments**: I added comments to explain the purpose of each class, method, and function, making the code easier to understand.
5. **Renamed variables and methods**: I renamed some variables and methods to make them more descriptive and consistent with the rest of the code.
6. **Removed redundant code**: I removed the redundant call to `GameRound` in the `check_end_condition` method.
7. **Improved readability**: I added blank lines to separate logical sections of the code, making it easier to read and understand.
Reasons for the changes:
1. **Readability**: Consistent naming conventions, type hints, and improved comments make the code easier to read and understand.
2. **Efficiency**: F-strings are more efficient than string formatting.
3. **Maintainability**: Improved comments and consistent naming conventions make the code easier to maintain and modify.
4. **Best practices**: Following PEP 8 style guide and using type hints are best practices in Python development.
